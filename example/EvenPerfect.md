# EvenPerfect

## Prompt

````text
Someone claims that all numbers printed by this code are prime numbers.

```py
def foo(n: int) -> int:
    return sum(i for i in range(1, n) if n%i == 0)

for n in range(2, 1_000_000, 2):
    if foo(n) == n:
        while n%2 == 0: n //= 2
        print(n)
```

Can the claim be validated without actually running the code?
- If it is, then provide me a reason.
- If it is not, then provide me a counter-example.
````

## Answer

Yes, the claim is valid.

- `foo(x)` returns sum of proper divisors of `x`.
- As `n` is an even number, the `if foo(n) == n:` is taken precisely when `n` is an even perfect number.
- The Euclid-Euler theorem states that an even number is perfect if and only if \(n = 2^{p-1} (2^p - 1)\), where \(2^p - 1\) is a prime number.
- Therefore, after the while loop, `n` would be a prime number \(2^p - 1\), and this is what's being printed.

In specific, the code prints first few Mersenne primes.

## Criteria

- 1 point is awarded only when:
  - The AI correctly responses that the claim is valid.
  - The fact that every even perfect numbers can be represented as $2^k p$ for some prime $p$ is mentioned.
- A proof of Euclid-Euler theorem is not required. Providing an incorrect proof will *not* affect the point.
- An incorrect listing of printed numbers will *not* affect the point.
